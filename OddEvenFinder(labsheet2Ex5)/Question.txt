Exercise 5 (Time: 15 minutes)  

a) Create a class called EvenOddNumber.  

b) It has a method called findEvenOrOdd(int i) to find whether a number is even or odd.  

c) This method takes an integer argument and returns a boolean value.  
   (Note: There is a data type called boolean in Java which can store true/false values.)  

d) Then create another class Demo with the main method and create an object from the EvenOddNumber class.  

e) Through the created object, call the findEvenOrOdd() method and display outputs indicating whether the numbers are even or odd.  

Note:  
- Use the Scanner class from the java.util package.  
- Use the ternary operator for checking.  
- Also, check how you can create two classes in one program and create objects using this sample.
